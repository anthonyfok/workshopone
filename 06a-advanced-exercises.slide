* Exercise One

Write a function that accepts two numbers, and prints a multiplication table between them

  multiplicationTable(4, 6)
  // Output
  X   4   5   6
  4  16  20  24
  5  20  25  30
  6  24  30  36

- Look into the _fmt_ package to understand how to print this better.
- Can you make this prettier? Add lines to highlight the header row and column? A label?

* Exercise Two

Write a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

- 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
- Did you use a loop or recursion?
- Do it the other way!

* Exercise Three

Write a function to calculate π

- Use the Gregory-Leibniz series: _(4/1)_-_(4/3)_+_(4/5)_-_(4/7)_+_(4/9)_-_(4/11)_..._
- Initially use 100 iterations.
- Can you allow the user to specify a precision in decimal digits. ie, 2 = 3.14. Perform no more iterations than necessary.

* Solution 1
